## Background

## PyBank - Challenge 1
---
In this challenge, I've been tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of my company. I've been given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, my company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll - Challenge 2
---
In this challenge, I've been tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. I have been given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
